# GPI2UDP
A little program, that is for using the preview function of an RCP to trigger <a href="https://github.com/bitfocus/companion">Bitfocus Companion</a> via UDP.

Main Goal was that I can press the Iris Lever on RCP to trigger a Button in Companion, which switches a Aux Output of an Atem Switcher or anything else. It should be easy to configure, because of changing setups.
